This is a MongoDB-based memory database for persistent storage of information.

IMPORTANT: Before using any memory operations, you MUST:
1. Call get_usage_guide() to understand proper usage patterns and examples
2. Call get_memory_structure() to understand the current memory organization

This will help you use the memory system effectively and avoid common mistakes.

Available operations: create_entities, get_entity, update_entity, delete_entity, find_entities, create_relationship, get_relationships, delete_relationship, get_memory_structure, get_usage_guide.
